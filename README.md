This is one of my best projects not because it's a good program but because it was one of the most useful pieces of code I ever developed. I went to Thomas Jefferson Highschool for Science and Technology from 2016 to 2020. At TJ we had a website, ion, where we would sign up for clubs. Most clubs had an extremely limited amount of seats. I created this program to login into ion and signup for the clubs I wanted at the start of every school day. I deployed it on our school's cluster alongside my actual CS Capstone. I am incredibly proud of this, even though the code itself is not that good.
